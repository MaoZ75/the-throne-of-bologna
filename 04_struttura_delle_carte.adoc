=== ROLES

Prince of Tortellini:: He pursues the joys of the flesh (in more than one sense) and he lives by the “seize the day” creed. He rules over many subjects and lands, but he does not care about them. He only cares about enjoying his five meals per day in peace…  Or at war.

High Dean:: A man of unquestionable moral compass and an unparalleled savant. He has spurned all material pleasures, and his only goal is to expand and improve his University, so that he can ensure his students’ wellbeing... and today’s students will one day be his subjects. Talk about a long term plan!

Lord of the Silk:: A lifetime of hard work has allowed him to become the most powerful merchant in the city. He is also the only one to know the secret of mass production of silk in his mills, which are disseminated along many channels. ***

Soldier of Fortune:: This warlord leads a company of ruthless mercenaries willing to kill and be killed for the highest bidder. Plunder and pillage are their bread and butter, and they prefer a lifetime of adventure to a safe shelter. We won’t argue with that.

Stern Cardinal:: In an age of saints and hermits, he is a politician, always ready to grant absolution to the other sinners. He embodies the Church’s temporal power, and he will not hesitate even for one second whenever he has the chance to claim new followers... and new riches.

Master Innkeeper (in a 3+ players game):: He lurks in the shadows and he knows the secrets of every citizen. He realizes he can claim the power only through his seedy knowledge, blackmailing the powerful. The walls in his inn have witnessed many incredible scenes.
The master Innkeeper’s victory condition is more elaborated than the other players’.

Brigand (only in  a 7 player game):: Although he acts like a lone wolf, he sits at the center of a thick web of thugs who keep informed and assist him in his devious plans. He may look nasty, but actually he is no worse than the others. Indeed, from time to time he has handed out a few coins to the poor!
This is the only role whose identity is revealed with the fist die roll.
