== GAME GOALS

Each player takes a role in the fictional version of Bologna depicted in “The Throne of Bologna”: to select their role, each player draws a Role card, which they must keep secret from the other players until the end of the game. Turn after turn, players roll their dice to gain goods and resources, or to unleash devastating effects against their rivals (or even upon themselves!): The game’s strategy depends on the role you are playing and on your own experience!
