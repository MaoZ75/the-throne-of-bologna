== OVERVIEW

Bologna, XIIIth century. The Empire, the Papacy, and the various Arts and Crafts Guilds are the movers and shakers who control the city. Bologna, with its ancient University and its population of 60.000, is the fifth most populous city in Europe, and the main textile center in Italy: Its wide trading network sustains the entire silk sector, connecting the city with the surrounding region, from the River Po to the Adriatic Sea. Bologna is a rich and cosmopolitan city where the food is fine and the wind is delicious, but it is also a city plagued by extreme social differences, political conspiracies, wars and plagues. In short, life is never boring!
Each player controls people and resources in order to claim the most important and coveted place of power in the city: The Throne of Bologna. Claiming the Iron Throne would be a piece of cake in comparison.
No weapons and no means are barred: will you be able to fulfill your goals and become the King of Bologna?
