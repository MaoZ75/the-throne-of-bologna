== PLAYING THE GAME

The following rules refer to a 3-5 players game. For a 2, 6, or 7 players game, see the Game Variants section at the end of the rulebook.

The game is played in turns. To decide who goes first, every player rolls five dice: The one who obtains the highest total of Bologna and Wine goes first. Then the game proceeds clockwise.

PHASE 1:: The first player rolls five dice and chooses three results.
PHASE 2:: The effects of the three chosen results are activated, one at a time. The player who rolled the dice decides in which order the results are activated.
PHASE 3:: The two remaining dice are passed to the next player.

The next player begins his PHASE 1 with the two results left from the previous player. If he likes them, he can decide to keep them both and just roll the other three dice (in this case, he will only choose one additional result). If he has no use for them, he can reject them and roll all five dice. The game then proceeds as described above.
